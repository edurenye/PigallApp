# PigallApp
Mobile application for Pigall, made with NativeScript

I recoment using the NativeScript Sidekick tool, for easy builds and deployments.

Otherwise install NativeScript with:

```
npm install nativescript -g
```

And Build for Android with:
```
tns build android
```

And for iOS (I never tried in iOS, no probably will break):
```
tns build ios
```
